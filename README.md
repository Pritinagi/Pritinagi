# Hi, I'm Priti! 👋

**Aspiring Data Engineer** | Transitioning from Web Development  
SQL Enthusiast • Python Builder • Crafting my first reliable data pipelines

I'm Priti — formerly a web developer (React, Django, etc.), now fully hooked on **data engineering**.  
I love taking messy raw data, cleaning it, transforming it, and building processes that make insights possible and reliable.

My core strengths right now: **SQL** (advanced queries, joins, windows, CTEs, optimization) and **Python** (pandas, ETL scripting, clean code).  
I'm learning the ecosystem hands-on: dbt for transformations, Airflow for orchestration, Docker for reproducibility — one project at a time.

> Clean data in → reliable pipelines out → happy teams downstream.

### What I'm Working On
- Mastering **SQL** for real-world scenarios (complex joins, CTEs, window functions, performance tuning)  
- Writing clean **Python** scripts for data processing and transformation  
- Building simple but solid **ETL/ELT pipelines** locally  
- Exploring orchestration (Airflow basics) and containerization (Docker)  
- Getting hands-on with free cloud tools when possible  

Still early in the journey, but consistent (daily practice, weekly commits), quick to learn from bugs, and always open to feedback/code reviews.

### Featured Projects
- **[sql-practice](https://github.com/pritinagi/sql-practice)**  
  Daily SQL grind: 100s of solved problems (basic → advanced) on real datasets. Heavy focus on joins, window functions, aggregations, subqueries, EXPLAIN plans. Explanations + optimization notes included.

- **[dbt-postgres-ecommerce-analytics](https://github.com/pritinagi/dbt-postgres-ecommerce-analytics)** *(upcoming/early)*  
  ELT practice on e-commerce data: staging → models → marts with dbt.  

- Past transferable example: **[ShopLocal](https://github.com/pritinagi/ShopLocal)**  
  Full-stack Django e-commerce app with Stripe + database integration — built solid SQL/API skills I'm now redirecting to data flows.

All repos include: clear setup guides, architecture sketches (when useful), run screenshots, failure lessons learned. Honest progress over polish.

### Tech Snapshot
**Confident**  
- Python 🐍 (pandas, scripting, basic OOP)  
- SQL 📊 (PostgreSQL / MySQL – queries, indexing, tuning)  

**Actively Learning**  
- dbt Core (models, tests, docs)  
- Apache Airflow (DAG basics, local runs)  
- Docker (containerizing pipelines)  
- Git + version control workflows  

Previous web stack (HTML/CSS/JS/React/Bootstrap/Django) → retired and grateful for the foundation.

### Let's Connect! 💬
Open to **Junior / Trainee / Intern Data Engineer roles** (India-based or remote-friendly hours).  
Also love: feedback on projects, code reviews, tips from DE folks, or just chatting about the field.
